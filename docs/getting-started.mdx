# Getting Started

Before you begin, it is important that you have a Drupal instance running with the GraphQL module installed. If you don't already have Drupal installed, we recommend you consider using [Drupal Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/TallerWebSolutions/drupal-enterprise-boilerplate).

## Clone

There is currently no CLI to scafold the project. The simplest way therefore is to clone this repository and start from there:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:TallerWebSolutions/next-on-drupal.git next-on-drupal
cd next-on-drupal
```

You might as well want to reset the repository before performing changes:

```sh
rm -Rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

## Install

```sh
yarn
```

## Run

To start the development server, execute the following:

```sh
yarn dev
```

> Notice that the application will try to connect to Drupal's GraphQL on the `http://localhost/graphql` endpoint (the default for the GraphQL Drupal module). This should be fine locally, but for production you'll probably need to override this, which can be done using the environment variable `GRAPHQL_HOST` (.i.e: `GRAPHQL_HOST=http://drupal-host/graphql yarn dev`).
