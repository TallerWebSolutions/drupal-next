# Env & Commands

## Docker

This boilerplate ships with a Docker container ready for development purposes. It should probably not be used in production, but we strongly recommend that you use this machine, as it will have equal versions on every development machine.

Have a look at the `Makefile` for the container-related commands. To get everything up-and-running, the basic command is:

```sh
make run
```

## Scripts and Commands

Besides the basic scripts shown in the [Getting Started](/getting-started), there are a bunch of task-specific or context-specific commands you can use as fit:
