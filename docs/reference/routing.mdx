# Routing

Next.js ships with a [file-system based routing](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#routing) by default, which means every file on the `./pages` directory is a served route and possible entrypoint for the application (with all the benefits of code-splitting). It also supports for [dynamic routing](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#custom-server-and-routing) via registering endpoints to the `express` server application and resolving access to these pages to a page know by Next.js (an existing path inside the `./pages` directory).

On top of that, this boilerplate adds Drupal based routing - a way to map any existing Drupal route to a page on Next.js.

> Another small change this boilerplate does is to move the `pages` directory inside `src`, respecting the idea that _any_ code related to the application itself should be under a common source-code directory. This is officially [not supported](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/4789) by Next.js, but we achieve this goal by having a symbolic link pointing from `./pages` to `./src/client/pages`. Everything seems to be working good with this approach - including HMR during development - but if any issue arrise from this technique, we can always fallback and move the `./src/client/pages` directory to the root of the project.

## Static routing

To add new static routes you can simply add `.js` files to the `./src/client/pages` directory. Example:

```js
// ./src/client/pages/custom.js
import React from 'react'

const CustomPage = () => <div>My custom page content</div>

export default CustomPage
```

The code above should be accessible on `http://localhost:3000/custom` when running the development server.

> The full path to the file from the `./src/client/pages` onwards will be accounted on the URL. i.e.: `./src/client/pages/foo/bar/baz.js` would be server under `http://localhost:3000/foo/bar/baz`

## Dynamic routing

To add dynamic routes, such as routes with path parameters, you must have a normal page file unsed the `pages` directory (same as above), but also and path handler on the `./server/index.js` file as follows;

```js
 const initializeServer = () => {
   const server = express()

+  server.get('/custom/:id', (req, res) => {
+    app.render(req, res, '/custom', req.params)
+  })
+
   // Drupal based route resolver.
   server.get('*', (req, res, next) =>
     resolve(req).then(route =>

```
