# Routing

Next.js ships with a [file-system based routing](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#routing) by default, which means every file on the `./pages` directory is a served route and possible entrypoint for the application (with all the benefits of code-splitting). It also supports for [dynamic routing](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#custom-server-and-routing) via registering endpoints to the `express` server application and resolving access to these pages to a page know by Next.js (an existing path inside the `./pages` directory).

On top of that, this boilerplate adds Drupal based routing - a way to map any existing Drupal route to a page on Next.js.

> Another small change this boilerplate does is to move the `pages` directory inside `src`, respecting the idea that _any_ code related to the application itself should be under a common source-code directory. This is officially [not supported](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/4789) by Next.js, but we achieve this goal by having a symbolic link pointing from `./pages` to `./src/client/pages`. Everything seems to be working good with this approach - including HMR during development - but if any issue arrise from this technique, we can always fallback and move the `./src/client/pages` directory to the root of the project.

## Static routing

To add new static routes you can simply add `.js` files to the `./src/client/pages` directory. Example:

```js
// ./src/client/pages/custom.js
import React from 'react'

const CustomPage = () => <div>My custom page content</div>

export default CustomPage
```

The code above should be accessible on `http://localhost:3000/custom` when running the development server.

> The full path to the file from the `./src/client/pages` onwards will be accounted on the URL. i.e.: `./src/client/pages/foo/bar/baz.js` would be server under `http://localhost:3000/foo/bar/baz`

## Dynamic routing

To add dynamic routes, such as routes with path parameters, you must have a normal page file unsed the `pages` directory (same as above), but also and path handler on the `./server/index.js` file as follows;

```js
 const initializeServer = () => {
   const server = express()

+  server.get('/custom/:id', (req, res) => {
+    app.render(req, res, '/custom', req.params)
+  })
+
   // Drupal based route resolver.
   server.get('*', (req, res, next) =>
     resolve(req).then(route =>

```

## Drupal based routing

Moving to a headless Drupal solution has it's tradeoffs - on of the biggest being dropping Drupal's well stablished [routing system](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/routing-system), and it's related modules, such as pathauto, redirects, token support, and so on. Although we cannot benefit from every aspect of Drupal's routing system, this boilerplates includes quite an important step towards it: the capacity to use Drupal to resolve paths.

This concept requires that we sometimes send a small request to Drupal to retrieve minimum information on a given path to identify if the path is a know route to the application. Not all paths should be understood by the application. In fact, this boilerplate ships only with the most obvious ones: path that represent nodes of type article and page, present in a default Drupal install.

This process of resolving paths on Drupal occurs in two different situations:

### During server-side request handling

Every requested path _not handled by Next.js_ will result in a route query against Drupal. In case we find a route, `/drupal` page component will be used to render the request.

  <Annotation line={5} />
  <Annotation line={14} to={19}>
    {({ components }) => (
      <div>
        When no Drupal route is found, we let Next.js default handler work (
        <components.inlineCode>next()</components.inlineCode>), often resulting
        in 404 pages. When a Drupal route is found, we serve the static page{' '}
        <components.inlineCode>/drupal</components.inlineCode>, which is then
        capable of deciding which page component to use for a given Drupal path.
      </div>
    )}
  </Annotation>
</AnnotatedCode>

### During client-side navigation

We can imperatively tell Next.js before-hand that a given link should be redered using the special `/drupal` page. For example, we might have links to related articles on a given page, in which case we already know that these links represent Drupal routes:

```js
import Link from 'next/Link'

const RelatedArticles = ({ articles = [] }) => (
  <div>
    <h3>Related Articles:</h4>
    <ul>{ articles.map(({ id, title, url }) => (
      <li key={id}>
        <Link href='/drupal' as={url}>
          <a>{title}</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
    )) }</ul>
  </div>
)
```

### Resolving a Drupal route

The special `/drupal` page can decide which other page to use, depending on the route received. i.e.: if it receives a route that represents an _article node_ entity, it might render a `/drupal/node/article` page.

This system is not restricted to entity representing paths, though: we provide the resolver with plenty of the route's metadata (which can even be modified for specifics), and is up to you to decide if and which page fits to render the given route.

You can study the related files in this annotated sources:
