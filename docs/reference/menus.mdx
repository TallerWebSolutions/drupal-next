# Menus

Drupal has a fully-featured menu administration system which, among other things:

1. Allows for the existence of multiple menus;
1. Allows any number of links in a menu;
1. Allows for both internal and external links;
1. Allows for links to have child links in any depth;
1. Allows to define which items should be extended;

This system is very user-friendly, and though some times a static set of links should be enough for most institutional sites, together with [Drupal based routing](./routing) the dynamic menu system included in _Next on Drupal_ presents a powerful way to control navigation from the administrative UI of Drupal into the React application.

## Usage

Drupal's GraphQL module already exposes menu information. We levarage that on the `MenuContainer` component to bring this information into the React app.

`MenuContainer` has an interface of props similar to that of `react-apollo`, using render-props to deliver data into presentation components.

Example:

<AnnotatedCode
  expanded
  initiallyOpen={false}
  name="MenuContainer example usage"
  code={require('!!raw-loader!~docz/samples/MenuContainer.1.js')}
>
  <Annotation line={5}>
    You must inform what menu to load links from (using the machine-name)
  </Annotation>
  <Annotation line={11}>
    You can map the items of a menu to show links
  </Annotation>
  <Annotation line={13} to={15}>
    {({ components }) => (
      <div>
        Links can either be internal (
        <components.inlineCode>routed</components.inlineCode>) or external. In
        case it is internal, we should delegate to the{' '}
        <components.inlineCode>/drupal</components.inlineCode> page for the
        dynamic routing to take place.
      </div>
    )}
  </Annotation>
</AnnotatedCode>

> Drupal allows for infinity hierarchy on menus. Each link can have it's own `links` property containing it's child links. You can control the depth of links the `MenuContainer` is supposed to bring using the `depth` property, which defaults to `1`.

### Links data

Drupal allows for extending what data a menu link has. Many modules do that for a variety of reasons; from link styling to attribute controls. To adapt `MenuContainer` to request for aditional information on a link, you can modify the `MenuLink` fragment on the GraphQL query used:

<AnnotatedCode
  initiallyOpen={false}
  name="~drupal/modules/menu/containers/MenuContainer/query.gql"
  code={require('!!raw-loader!~drupal/modules/menu/containers/MenuContainer/query.gql')}
>
  <Annotation line={49} to={57} />
</AnnotatedCode>
