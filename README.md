This project is a boilerplate aimed to facilitate scafolding of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects based on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) backends exposed via [GraphQL](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql).

On [the documentation](https://next-on-drupal.surge.sh) you find explanation on many of the concepts, solutions, and whys for most of the decisions you'll find along the way in the code.

> This boilerplate is well fit to be used in company with the [Drupal Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/TallerWebSolutions/drupal-enterprise-boilerplate) project.
